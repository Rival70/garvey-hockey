The club has made its name for itself over several decades with players representing the country that were trained and raised on the grounds of the club, presenting themselves to the world as top players. The clubs current location features a main building with two pitches. Located in Hillsborough, this club has many sponsorships and is generally a well-known club within Northern Ireland. Lisnagarvey Hockey club provides training and competitive services to anyone that is interested as well as providing social gatherings for club members and non-members alike. Employment within the club involves playing members and a central committee that meet together to discuss changes to the club and what the next decision will be focused on. Once the committee comes to an agreement, the club will initiate the changes over a small period of time and will focus their efforts and funds within these ideas.</font>

    <font face="georgia" color="white"><p style="width=20px;"><font size="4">
    The company has a method and policy on recruiting/joining members. For young members trying to join the club, the club has to make sure the parents are involved in the process as payment on a yearly basis is needed for a playing member. A waiting list is used to handle potential members. This method is used to check the background of potential members such as finding previous clubs, why did they leave them etc. After a background check is done and the member is accepted, they will have to pay an admission fee for a year before being recognised as a full time player. For older members however, the same process is used but the member doesnt have to obtain permission for parents if they pass the legal age of eighteen.</font>

    Lisnagarvey Hockey Club can trace it's foundation back to September 1901 when three young Lisburn men met in the local Temperance Institute and talked about starting a Club. They canvassed support and it was decided to form Lisnagarvey. The three founder-members were RC Bannister, who became Captain, EL Wilson, the Honorary Treasurer and WS Duncan, the Honorary Secretary. The annual subscription for playing members was five shillings, and the original colours were light and dark blue.
</p>
    <p style="width=50px;"><font face="georgia" color="white"><font size="4">
    The subscription for playing members was to be 5 shillings and for Vice-Presidents half a guinea. The club colours would be light and dark blue. The original members were W. S. Duncan, R. C. Bannister, B. Boyd, E. Boyd, F. Garrett, R. V. Hamilton, Hector B. Hanna, J. G. Hanna, N. G. Kilpatrick, E. S. H. Thompson, E. E. Wilson, I. H. Wilson and J. H. Wilson. Later they were joined by H. H. Burrowes, H. E. Gamble, S. McMurray, V. McMurray, G. McGrath, D. McCartney and R. Rainey. The only survivor of that august band is Mr. Hector Hanna, now living in retirement in Dundalk. Not in their wildest dreams could the twenty-odd young men have realized that from these modest beginnings was to emerge what was to become Ireland's most famous hockey club. It was not the first hockey club to be formed in the town. That distinction belonged to the Lisburn Hockey Club founded in 1897.
</p>
    <p style="width=50px;"><font face="georgia" color="white"><font size="4">
    Their playing headquarters were on the Magheralave Road at what is now the Friends School rugby pitch. This ground was later taken over by Lisnagarvey and was occupied by them until the mid-thirties. The Lisburn colours were green, old gold and black. Their President, Dr. Keightley in 1899 presented a cup to the Ulster Branch, first won by North Down and now presented to the winners of the Senior League. In 1900 one of their players, 1. F. Robinson, was selected at full-back for Ulster. They were very much the premier Lisburn team, as Lisnagarvey started in the minor ranks, while Lisburn had achieved senior status.

A ground was obtained on the Magheralave Road, by the good offices of Mr. J. A. Wilson.

    The infant club seems to have had its share of teething troubles. Quite a few of the original members were either expelled or "compulsorily retired", the difference is not immediately apparent. This was for various misdemeanours. Indeed it is ironic that in a Club, the name of which, from the Gaelic, means the "fort of the gamesters", any form of gambling, however innocent, was severely frowned on. The power of the committee was limited, and much of the routine business was transacted at a series of special general meetings. Members of Committee were sometimes fined for failure to carry out directives. In the opening season there was a reshuffle with R. C. Bannister resigning the Captaincy and being replaced by W. S. Duncan, Mr. Bannister became Secretary and when E. E. Wilson was expelled he was replaced by J. H. Wilson as Treasurer. 
</p>
    <p style="width=50px;"><font face="georgia" color="white"><font size="4">
    In the following year the entire Committee was censured at a Special Meeting and replaced by a complete new Committee. These internal squabbles led to a breakaway of a few members to join the rival and now Senior Lisburn Club, and relations between the two were rather strained. There is a story that on one occassion two 'Garvey members encountered two of their rivals near the drinking fountain in the Wallace Park. High words ensued until one of the 'Garvey pair asked his friend to hold his cuffs while he dealt summarily with the opposition.
</p>
    <p style="width=50px;"><font face="georgia" color="white"><font size="4">
    Finance, or the lack of it, was another problem. There is a tradition that some committee meetings were held in the waiting room at Railway Street Station, hardly with the approval of the Great Northern Railway. Still another special meeting decided to augment club funds by imposing an admission charge of one penny. Later several members were appointed as stewards to ensure that spectators did not dodge their responsibilities.
